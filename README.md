## WeatherApp
This is my first app created during the SheCodes Plus coding workshop

It allows users to search for a city by name or your current location and shows:

- current weather (weather, temperature, description, humidity, wind speed and what it feels like)
- hourly forecast (weather, maximum and minimum temperature).

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Bootstrap (for the grid, search form and buttons)
- Open Weather Map API with axios
